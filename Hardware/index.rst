Why This?
=========

| The answer is on your hands!.
|
| Nowadays almost everyone has at least one computing device, and almost a 60% of the world population has internet.
| 
| It doesn't matter whether its a PC, laptop, phone, server, x86 or ARM; If you are reading this it means you are using any of them.
| But, do you really know whats inside it or how does it work? Why did you buy it and what do you use it for? What's its performance?
| 
| Dont worry, most people don't need to know the answer to those questions since that's one of the systems administrators jobs;
| 
| **Choosing the best hardware for the required job and making sure it works the way it should.**
| 
| Every good system admin must have a wide hardware knowledge since it's the vital part of any computing structure.
| Some questions admins must be able to answer before getting a piece of hardware are;

- Will it perform the best with the chosen software?
- How long will it last?
- Is it powerful enough?
- How reliable is it?
- Is it upgradeable?
- How much does it cost?
- Does it come with any warranty?

| Every project no matter what it is or even if it doesn't talk about hardware at all, must use it.
| Even tho people can use virtual machines that means not only using the host PC, but also a virtual one that may have different features.
| 
| **If theres no hardware, theres nothing else.**
