Case
====

| The case is a server tower size that supports EATX [#]_ motherboards with dual socket. It comes with the following features

- 4 3,5" Hot Swap HDD [#]_ Bays
- 2 5,24" Drive Bays
- Double SFF PSU Support
- Intrusion Detection
- Key lock
- Cooling Traverse & RAM Support

| The seller didn't have the traverse or any fan and just 2 HDD caddies [#]_.
| I had to mod the case front panel with a hammer and bend it so I was able to place more fans and improve the airflow.
