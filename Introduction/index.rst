Introduction

| MasterServer is an original project idea by Efren Garcia Ferez & Jose Domingo Alvarez Caba.
|
| It started with the need of a Minecraft server to make a comunity where everyone could play for free. With the knowledge that we mostly earned by ourselves and seeking for more, we decided to bring it up a level and create a whole server structure to host the Minecraft server at home.
|
| MasterServer turned from a single Minecraft server into a whole computing hardware and software structure composed by the following.
| 

- Datacenter Hardware Structure
- Java Edition Minecraft Server
- Bedrock Edition Minecraft Server
- Webpage Stack
- Statistics Stack
- Backup & Media Server
- Discord Server
- Digital Marketing Plan

| 
| Efren has done everything found in this document.
| Jose Domingo has done all the coding part, which can be found in the *Development* section of the complete document posted in GitHub (since the given instructions say to hand it in separately).
|
| Each one has documented its own part of the project
| 
| With this project we did not only dig into new knowledge areas and expand those that we already knew about, but also work as a whole team performing a real life situation where the decisions of one member affects the other, a programmer cannot exist without a system administrator and vice versa.
| We met and outranged our goals, reaching things that we didn't know we could.
