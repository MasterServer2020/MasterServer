| This project is dedicated to those teachers that said a cluster was a crazy idea and couldn't be made at school or anywhere, that sys admins should let a "technician" repair their hardware, to those that underestimated my skills and project, and finally to those that were against doing this collaborative project involving a sysadmin and programmer.
| 
| I turned what some considered stupid or impossible things into goals and facts.
| 
| Thanks to the teachers who believed in us and gave us a chance to make true this project. It wouldn't have ever been possible for this project to be done if it wasn't by you.
| 
| Thanks to the teachers that are whiling and still like learning, value real work and do things well and the right way.
| 
| Special thanks to Pilar for empowering the idea of the project, helping and being interested from the beginning to the end.
| 
| Special thanks to Modesto for always making us laugh and enjoy his classes and staying in contact.
| 
| Finally special thanks to Jose Luis for being the best sysadmin I know. Taught me tons of things that were used in this project, from virtualization architectures to basic commands. Also for showing me a system running Proxmox, talking to me about Sphinx and the daisy chain concept of SAS cables, that's where I got all the motivation from to learn all I know from this last 3 months and put it in a real project.
| 
| 
| With love for Modesto, Pilar and Jose Luis.
