Minecraft
=========

| **Minecraft** is a sandbox game originally launched in 2012 for PC and coded in Java.
| 
| It doesn't have an ending even tho there are 2 main bosses. The world is generated chunk by chunk as the player explores new areas.
| There are multiple kind of mobs, which are creatures in the game, both peaceful or hostile.
| There are lots of multiplayer servers and anyone can create its own one for free.
| There are 5 main gamemodes.

- **Survival**; Default gamemode where the player has a health and hunger meter.
- Hardcore; Unlike survival, the player only has a single life. Once it dies you cannot respawn again and the world will be deleted.
- **Creative**; The player has unlimited resources, is able to do commands and also fly.
- Spectator; The player can see other players but not interact with anything.
- Adventure; The player can only break blocks with defined tools through commands.

| The survival version has 4 difficulties that can be changed.

- Hard
- Medium
- Easy
- Peaceful

| Increasing the difficulty means stronger mobs which will deal more damage to the player. In peaceful mode, hostile mobs can't spawn and the player can't die from hunger.
| Minecraft allows developers to create new **mods** and **plugins** that add new functionalities, items or structures to the game.
